The HTTP lecture was both interesting and informative. Relating the notion of a function to something familiar like a webpage helped clarify the notion of what a function really is. 

In reality, the process of accessing a web page involves lots of functions. We can create various layers of abstraction:

->For the client, the web browser essentially takes a URL as input and returns a page as output.

->The browser takes a URL and outputs a request to the relevent server

->Google takes a request for a web page as input and returns a web page

Several additional "functions" are operating on the clients computer and Google's server (as well as in between) in order to make that happen.

The lecture really broadened my understanding of the nature and purpose of functions, and allowed me to gain a more abstract understanding of what a function does in the realm of computing
