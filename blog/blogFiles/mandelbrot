This task challenged me physically, emotionally, psychologically, intellectually and spiritually. I started by planning (https://rend0g.com/comp1917/planning) the task - How would i break it down into small, managable pieces? How would i use the knowledge i have acquired to complex this complex and multi-faceted assignment.

1. Research

I had two primary areas that i needed to research before beginning my planning for this task

a) I had to research the mandelbrot set

My journey initially took me the wikipedia entry on the mandelbrot set. 

The mandelbrot set is a set of vectors on the complex plane which satisfy a certain special inequality.

A vector (c) is said to lie in the mandelbrot set if it's modulus remains less than 2 after an infinite amount
of iterations of

z(n+1) = z(n)^2+c

For example, vector 1+0i would be

z(2) = |1| + |1| which is too big

The vector -1/2 + 0i would be 

z(2) = 1/4 - 1/2
z(3) = 1/4 - 1/2
.......

Therefore, it can be said that -1/2 +0i lies in the mandelbrot set since it remains less than 2 forever

Once i had a good understanding of what the mandelbrot set was, i thought about how i might test whether or not a number was within the mandelbrot set

b) I needed to refresh my understanding of the bitmap file structure



2. Planning

3. Implementation

4. Debugging

5. DONE!
