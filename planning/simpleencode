		SIMPLE ENCODE FUNCTION
----------------------------------------

Task goal
==========

To create a function which takes inputs of:

1. A single character 
2. A "cipher"

And returns an output which scrambles the single character with the cipher.

The cipher is a pseudo-alphabet which matches lowercase letters a through with z with any given characters.

Function I/O
============

- Input 1 is char 
- Input 2 is a string that is NECESSARILY of length 26
- Output is char

DATA structures
===============

1. Both the clear and cipher alphabet should be arrays of length 26
2. Return value should be a char

Task approach
=================

We may break this task down into three parts:

1. Match cipher alphabet with a->z
2. Locate input char within cleartext alphabet (a->z or NULL)
3. Return the matched char in the cipher alphabet

Logical flow of program
=======================

GET input(char) AND cipher(string)
CREATE array(26) OF EACH char in cipher 1->26 (cipherAlphabet)
CREATE array(26) OF EACH char in alphabet a->z (standardAlphabet)
LOCATE input IN standardAlphabet AS INTEGER (cipherInt) referring to position in standardAlphabet
GET char (cipherChar) FROM cipherAlphabet WITH index cipherInt OR NULL
RETURN cipherChar or char (IF cipherChar IS NULL)
